# Problem 1: Asynchronous and Synchronous Communication

Suppose a file of 10000 bytes is to be sent over a line at 2400 bps.

## Problem 1. Asynchronous Communication

**Given:**
- File size: 10000 bytes
- Line speed: 2400 bps
- 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits per character
- No parity bit

**Calculations:**

1. **Total bits per character:**
Total bits per character = 1 (start bit) + 8 (data bits) + 1 (stop bit) = 10 bits
2. **Total characters:**
Total characters = 10000 bytes / 1 byte/character = 10000 characters
3. **Total bits to be sent:**
Total bits = 10000 characters * 10 bits/character = 100000 bits
4. **Overhead bits:**
Overhead bits = 100000 bits - (10000 bytes * 8 bits/byte) = 20000 bits
5. **Time to send the file:**
Time = 100000 bits / 2400 bps = 41.67 seconds

## 2. Synchronous Communication

**Given:**
- File size: 10000 bytes
- Line speed: 2400 bps
- Frame size: 1000 characters (8000 bits)
- Overhead: 48 control bits per frame

**Calculations:**

1. **Total frames:**
Total frames = (10000 bytes * 8 bits/byte) / 8000 bits/frame = 10 frames

2. **Total bits to be sent:**
Total bits = (10000 bytes * 8 bits/byte) + (10 frames * 48 control bits/frame) = 80000 bits + 480 bits = 80480 bits

3. **Overhead bits:**
Overhead bits = 80480 bits - 80000 bits = 480 bits

4. **Time to send the file:**
Time = 80480 bits / 2400 bps = 33.53 seconds

## Summary

- **Asynchronous Communication:**
  - Overhead: 20000 bits
  - Time: 41.67 seconds

- **Synchronous Communication:**
  - Overhead: 480 bits
  - Time: 33.53 seconds

# Problem 2: CRC8 Error Detection

Suppose we want to transmit the message `1011 0010 0100 1011` and protect it from errors using the CRC8 polynomial \( x^8 + x^2 + x + 1 \). Determine the message that should be transmitted.

## Given:
- Message: `1011 0010 0100 1011`
- CRC8 Polynomial: \( x^8 + x^2 + x + 1 \) (binary: `100000111`)

## Steps:

1. **Append 8 zeros to the original message:**
1011 0010 0100 1011 00000000


2. **Perform binary division using the CRC polynomial:**

- **Initial message with appended zeros:**
  ```
  1011 0010 0100 1011 00000000
  ```

- **CRC Polynomial:**
  ```
  100000111
  ```

- **Perform binary division (showing only the first few steps for brevity):**
  ```
  10110010 01001011 00000000 (message with appended zeros)
  100000111 (CRC polynomial)
  ----------------
  00110001 01001011 00000000
  00000000 100000111
  ----------------
  00110001 11001011 00000000
  00000000 100000111
  ----------------
  00110001 01001011 00000000
  ```

- **Continue the division until the end of the message. The remainder is the CRC checksum.**

3. **Append the CRC checksum to the original message:**
1011 0010 0100 1011 (original message) + CRC checksum


4. **Final transmitted message:**
1011 0010 0100 1011 CRC_checksum


(Note: The actual CRC checksum needs to be calculated using the division process or an online CRC calculator.)

## Summary

- **Original Message:** `1011 0010 0100 1011`
- **CRC Polynomial:** `100000111`
- **Transmitted Message:** `1011 0010 0100 1011 CRC_checksum`

# Problem 5

### 1. What type of multiplexing is shown in Figure 1?
- Based on the problem description, the figure likely illustrates **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**:
  - Multiple signals are assigned specific time slots on a shared channel.
  - Each signal uses the entire bandwidth for a short period, but only during its designated time slot.

### 2. What is the purpose of guard time?
- **Guard time** is a small time interval added between time slots in TDM to:
  - Prevent overlapping of signals due to timing mismatches.
  - Reduce the chances of interference or data corruption.

---

# Problem 6

### Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):

#### Given:
- **Number of signals**: 10.
- **Bandwidth per signal**: 4000 Hz.
- **Guard band**: 400 Hz between each signal.

#### Calculation:
- Total bandwidth required for signals: \( 10 \times 4000 = 40,000 \, \text{Hz} \).
- Guard bands for 10 signals (9 gaps): \( 9 \times 400 = 3600 \, \text{Hz} \).
- **Minimum total bandwidth**:
  \[
  40,000 + 3,600 = 43,600 \, \text{Hz}.
  \]

### Final Answer:
- **Minimum bandwidth required**: **43,600 Hz**.

#### 2. Receiver receives sequence `(-2 -2 0 -2 0 -2 +4 0)`. What did channel B transmit?
- Use the chip sequence for channel B to decode:
  - Multiply the received sequence element-wise by B’s chip sequence.
  - Sum the results and divide by the length of the sequence.

\]
\[
1 + SNR = 2^{6.67}
\]
\[
SNR = 2^{6.67} - 1 \approx 102.38
\]

#### Final Answer:
- **SNR (linear)**: \( 102.38 \).

- **Example**: Dijkstra's algorithm is commonly used for this purpose.

### 3. Difference between an interior router protocol and an exterior router protocol:
- **Interior Router Protocol (IRP)**:
  - Used within a single autonomous system (e.g., OSPF, RIP).
  - Focuses on efficiency and quick convergence within the system.
- **Exterior Router Protocol (ERP)**:
  - Used between different autonomous systems (e.g., BGP).
  - Focuses on policies and agreements between networks.

### 4. What is a Choke Packet in the context of congestion?
- A **choke packet** is a control packet sent by a network node to the source of traffic to signal congestion.
- It instructs the source to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate congestion.

# Problem 29

### 1. Size of the Total Length field in bits:
- The Total Length field is **16 bits**.

### 2. Minimum size of the datagram (if there is no data):
- The minimum size of an IPv4 header is **20 bytes (160 bits)**.

### 3. Maximum size of the datagram:
- The Total Length field is 16 bits, so the maximum value is \( 2^{16} - 1 = 65535 \).
- The maximum size of the datagram is **65535 bytes**.

### 4. Size of the datagram when the Total Length field is `0xABCD`:
- `0xABCD` in decimal is \( 43981 \).
- The size of the datagram is **43981 bytes**.

# Problem 30

### Consider address notation `192.168.5.85/24`:
1. **Bits used for the network**: The `/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are allocated for the network.
2. **Bits used for the hosts**: There are 32 bits in total for an IPv4 address. With 24 bits for the network, the remaining 8 bits are for the hosts.

### Conclusion:
- **Network bits**: 24.
- **Host bits**: 8.

# Problem 31

### 1. Differences between datagrams and virtual circuits:
- **Datagrams**:
  - Packets are treated independently of each other.
  - Each packet may take a different route to the destination.
  - No connection is established before data transfer begins.
  - More suitable for dynamic or unreliable networks.
  
- **Virtual Circuits**:
  - A connection-oriented communication model.
  - A predefined path is established and maintained for the duration of the connection.
  - All packets follow the same route, ensuring order.
  - More suitable for stable networks.

### 2. Other names for these two approaches:
- **Datagrams**: Connectionless packet switching.
- **Virtual Circuits**: Connection-oriented packet switching.

### 3. Practical analogies:
- **Datagrams**: Similar to mailing letters through the postal service, where each letter is routed independently.
- **Virtual Circuits**: Similar to a phone call, where a dedicated line is established for the entire conversation.
